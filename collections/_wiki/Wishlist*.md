## Technology

### Firestarting
+ required for both food (the ability to cook and therefore make much greater proportions of nutrition available and digestible) and safety (for warmth, visibility, and protection from predators)
+ [firestarting technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_making)
   - heat source: friction, percussion, burning glass
   - tinder to catch: fine material that combusts easily and quickly, relatively speaking; the more surface area, the faster it will catch.
      - unprocessed: birch bark, dry pine needles, dry leaves, dry grass, certain species of fungus, fatwood (resin-impregnated heartwood from decayed of pine trees), wood shavings, bird down, twigs
      - processed: paper, cloth, rope, cotton, other plant fibre material, magnesium shavings
   - fuel to burn for the long term: wood, charcoal, peat
+ "Starting a fire has never been an easy trick. No one knows how our prehistoric ancestors managed. They may have snatched burning branches from wildfires or generated sparks by rock-banging; some guess we may have acquired fire as a lucky off-shoot of chipping stone tools. ... Otzi, the 5000-year-old Iceman discovered in 1991 by hikers in the Italian Alps, cautiously carried his fire along with him, in the form of embers wrapped in maple leaves and stored in a birchbark box. As back-up, he was also equipped with a fire-starting kit, consisting of iron pyrites, flint, and tinder fungus. The Neolithic technique seems to have involved grinding the fungus until it was fine and fluffy, then piling it in a mollusk shell, and striking sparks with the flint and pyrite until the tinder ignited."

### Food and water
+ What kinds of plants, animals, fungi, and minerals occur in the immediate vicinity? Are they palatable? Safe to eat? Nutritious? What are the basic components of a diet that meets your full nutritional requirements?
+ What kind of tools are needed to gather the food? Specialized equipment is obviously necessary for hunting and fishing, but just because plants aren't a moving target doesn't mean that they can't be finicky to collect. In terms of hunting and fishing, for many species you can probably get away with weighty rocks and pointy sticks, but the larger, faster, and more distant your prey gets the more you'll have to rely on blade technology like spears and arrows.
+ If your food sources are any distance away, you'll need ways of transporting the food back home: baskets or pottery might do for plants, but for large game you might need to pull the carcass on skids, or butcher it on-site, meaning you'll still need to carry a suite of tools with you.
+ Plenty of foods are fine to eat raw, but you're almost certainly going to want to cook or otherwise process something at some point. What methods are used?
   - open fire with or without a hearth, the most basic of which is just an enclosure of stones. food can be roasted on long skewers, cooked directly in the coals or hot ashes, steamed in wet leaves over embers, toasted on the surface of hot flat rocks, or boiled in hollow or dish-shaped stones or other heat resistant objects. structures could also be built to suspend food above the fire, such as a spit or trivet, or hooks to hang vessels from; or propped on rocks surrounding the fire, such as a grate or grill or curved dish on which food or cooking vessels could be placed, like a griddle or shallow wok or [tava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tava) or [kazan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazan_(cookware))
   - [link](https://guide.michelin.com/sg/en/article/features/4-ancient-cooking-methods-revisited)
   - [earth ovens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_oven) or cooking pits. these are essentially universal across human cultures: pits in which a fire is allowed to burn down to a smoulder, food is placed in the bottom and covered, and left to cook. rocks may be added to the bottom of the oven to heat and to give food a surface to cook on, or simply a reservoir for heat once the fire is no longer burning; other methods may involve simply placing the food directly in the ashes or the hot earth beneath. the food may be wrapped in vegetation or encased in clay before cooking; food is typically baked in the dry heat, but a layer of moisture-containing vegetation may be laid down under the food in order to steam it. they can also be used to cook vessels of food including liquid - branches or other materials are used to form a surface over the pit like a grill over a campfire, and dishes placed on top. earth ovens can be very large and thus labour-intensive to create, but they are capable of cooking vast quantities of food efficiently
      - stones may explode if they contain moisture bc of the steam generated--non porous rock necessary
      - indoor hearths may consist of essentially an earth oven, and may be lined with stone, clay, or brick
   - [clay oven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_clay_oven) or cob oven, another pretty widespread type that changes little across cultures. constructed of clay or cob (combination of clay, sand, and straw or similar fibrous materials), which is fireproof, they are typically, dome-, cone-, or beehive-shaped, though some are cylindrical. the opening through which food and kindling are placed inside may be in the front or on the top, with an accompanying door or lid. an additional hole near the base may be made to allow easier access for stoking the fire and clearing away ashes, as well as to ensure air circulation. these stoves were primarily used for baking: bread dough could be placed on the floor of the oven, or pressed against the walls where it would adhere until it was baked. other cooking methods could be used; cooking vessels could be placed inside the oven or on top of the lid
      - an extremely basic form of this type of oven can be formed by putting a clay pot upside down over a hot surface, such as a rock heated in an earth oven
   - [masonry ovens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masonry_oven) are closely related to the clay oven, but are built using brick or stone and mortar; brick construction requires access to a kiln
   - stoves: [brazier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazier), shichirin/hibachi, fire pot
   - the majority of cooking vessels require ceramic or metalworking technology
      - [pot boilers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pot_boiler) are stones heated in a fire and then dropped into a vessel of water in order to boil it. this method can be used for pottery cultures that cannot withstand cooking temperatures
+ How plentiful is food? If you're somewhere like a rainforest, which has essentially a year-round growing season and dense and diverse animal populations, depending on the size of your community it's possible you don't need to put any food aside at all. Otherwise, though, some sort of preservation will be necessary. What methods of preservation are used? Drying, smoking, and salting are the most low-tech methods; if the climate is cold enough freezing might be an option. How do you store your excess food? Cured meats and dried bundles of plants hanging from the rafters? A storehouse full of crockery? Bags made from naturally watertight animal stomachs? A pit in the frozen earth?
   - animal stomachs? woven baskets or bags? ceramic crockery?
   - air drying requires no tools other than periods of sunshine. salting is simply the addition of dry salt. pickling makes food too acidic for bacteria to form and can be accomplished by introduction of lactic acid-producing bacteria, or by addition of a liquid such as brine, vinegar, or alcohol. conversely, the addition of lye makes the food too alkaline for bacteria to form. smoking requires fire in an enclosed space in which to expose food to smoke for up to several days. liquid can be boiled to kill microbes; sugar (such as suspension in honey) can be used to inhibit bacterial growth. jellying, cooking in a material that solidifies to a gel such as gelatin, agar, and arrowroot flour
   - chilling: icehouses, cellars, and pits used to store ice and snow, and insulated for cold storage
   - evaporative cooling: yakhchal, coolgardie safe; jars of boiling water placed on roofs at night
+ where do you get your water? a nearby body of water? an underground source? captured rainwater? is it safe to drink or does it require processing? what local environmental hazards might cause contamination and how are they accounted for?
   - filtration methods
   - purification methods

### Shelter
What's the climate like? The temperature? The amount of sunlight? If it's always warm out and shelter from the sun is easily accessible clothes might not be necessary; in other circumstances they're critical. What are they made of? Animal skins? Plant fibres? What kind of processing do they go through to make them wearable, comfortable, and weather-resistant? What kinds of tools are necessary to process them?

Fire can be used as a means of protection in a couple ways: to provide warmth, and to keep dangerous or hungry animals away. If the climate is favourable, sleeping around a campfire might be all the protection you need. At some point, though, it's likely you'll need some sort of structure to take cover in, whether to bed down in during cold winters or just to get out of the sun in the afternoons.

Is there any sort of natural shelter in the area, like a cave or a rock overhang? Does it provide protection from both weather and wildlife? If you have to make your own, what materials are available to build a shelter with? Reeds, bamboo, wood? Brush, thatch? Mud that can be made into bricks? Stone? Leather, fleece, woven fabric? The climate will dictate what resources are plentiful, and also what weather conditions you'll have to plan for.

Are the structures permanent or temporary? How many people can they hold? Are they weather-resistant? Are they meant for round-the-clock-habitation? How is temperature regulated? Are they ventilated? Insulated? Can fires be lit inside them? Is a long-term heat source necessary?
+ is there somewhere to shelter from weather or predators? if not, what materials are available to build a shelter with? are the structures permanent or temporary?
   - natural caves and rock shelters
   - tents: flexible covering on a pole frame, portable
      - tipi: famously of the indigenous peoples of the american great plains and canadian prairies. cone-shaped; wooden pole frame, buffalo hide cover, optional skin or cloth lining, canvas or bison calf skin door; rawhide ropes, wooden pegs. tipis have an opening at the top and smoke flaps to allow ventilation while using a fire inside
      - tupiq: inuit; made from seal or caribou skin
      - yurt or ger, felted fleece
   - pit-houses: partially sunken into the ground, plus a roof which may be tent-like in structure or made of more permanent materials. surrounded by soil and largely protected by wind due to their lowered profile, they

+ How do you get a good night's sleep - on bare ground? A bed of leaves? A woven mat? A frame lifted off the ground? A hammock? Are the nights cold? Do you need a heat source or a way to keep heat in?
   - mats or bedrolls
   - frame bed or platform bed
   - hammock; charpai
   - mattress or futon
   - sheets or protectors
   - blankets: woven, knitted or crocheted, quilts
   - comforter, duvet, razai
