Reference notes

## Essential nutrients

Essential nutrients are nutrients that cannot be synthesized in the human body. Many other amino acids and fatty acids exist, but can be readily synthesized from other substances in the body and in the diet, and therefore it is not necessary to supplement the diet with them.

### Amino acids

+ **Histidine**: synthesized by plants
+ **Isoleucine**: eggs, soy protein, seaweed, turkey, chicken, lamb, cheese, fish
+ **Leucine**: whey protein, legumes, beef, fish, wheat germ, almonds, chicken, eggs, oats
+ **Lysine**: eggs, red meat, lamb, pork, poultry, legumes, cheese (particularly Parmesan), cod, sardines
+ **Methionine**: eggs, sesame seeds, brazil nuts, Parmesan cheese, hemp seeds, meat, chia seeds, wheat germ, legumes
+ **Phenylalanine**: eggs, chicken, liver, beef, milk, soybeans
+ **Threonine**: cottage cheese, poultry, fish, meat, legumes, sesame seeds
+ **Tryptophan**: spirulina, cod, soybeans, cheese, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, meat, chickpeas, eggs, oats
+ **Valine**: meats, dairy products, soy products, legumes

Proteins are formed by chains of amino acids linked by peptide bonds. The digestive process breaks down proteins, releasing energy, and making the free amino acids bioavailable. A source of protein that contains all nine essential amino acids is known as a complete protein.

### Fatty acids

+ **Alpha-linolenic acid**, an omega-3 fatty acid: flaxseed, walnuts, chia, hemp, many common vegetable oils
+ **Linoleic acid**, an omega-6 fatty acid: nuts, fatty seeds (flax seeds, hemp seeds, poppy seeds, sesame seeds, etc.) and their derived vegetable oils

Lipids or fats are formed by a glycerol molecule with three fatty acids attached. As with proteins, the digestive process breaks down fats, releasing energy, and making the free fatty acids bioavailable.

In a saturated fat, all of the carbon atoms in the fatty acid chains are bonded to a hydrogen atom in a single bond. Most animal products—meat, lard or schmaltz, and milk and milk products—are rich in saturated fat, as well as a few plant sources such as coconut oil and cocoa butter. In an unsaturated fat, at least one bond between a carbon and hydrogen atom is a double bond. One double bond makes a monounsaturated fat, while many double bonds makes a polyunsaturated fat. These are abundant in plant sources such as nuts, seeds, and vegetable oils—both fatty acids listed above are polyunsaturated—but are also found in animal sources.

Colloquially, fat often refers to a lipid that is solid at room temperature (typically saturated), while a lipid that is liquid at room temperature (typically unsaturated) is known as an oil.

Trans fats, a type of unsaturated fat, occur naturally in small amounts in meat and dairy products, but are mostly a byproduct of hydrogenation. This is a process meant to produce saturated fat from an unsaturated one in order to modify the melting point and make it solid at room temperature.

### Minerals

+ **Potassium**: sweet potato, tomato, potato, beans, lentils, dairy products, seafood, bananas, prunes, carrots, oranges
+ **Chlorine**: table salt
+ **Sodium**: table salt, sea vegetables, milk, spinach
+ **Calcium**: dairy products, eggs, sardines, salmon, green leafy vegetables, nuts, seeds, tofu and other soy products
+ **Phosphorus**: red meat, dairy products, fish, poultry, bread, rice, oats
+ **Magnesium**: spinach, legumes, nuts, seeds, whole grains, avocado
+ **Iron**: meat, seafood, nuts, beans, dark chocolate
+ **Zinc**: oysters, red meat, poultry, nuts, whole grains, dairy products
+ **Manganese**: grains, legumes, seeds, nuts, leafy vegetables, tea, coffee
+ **Copper**: liver, seafood, oysters, nuts, seeds; certain whole grains and legumes
+ **Iodine**: seaweed, grains, eggs, iodized salt
+ **Chromium**: broccoli, grape juice (especially red), meat, whole grain products
+ **Molybdenum**: legumes, whole grains, nuts
+ **Selenium**: Brazil nuts, seafood, organ meats, grains, dairy products, eggs

### Vitamins

+ **Vitamin A** (all-*trans*-Retinol, carotenoids): Fish, liver, dairy products, orange vegetables, leafy vegetables
+ <strong>Vitamin B<sub>1</sub></strong> (thiamine): pork, whole grains, brown rice, vegetables, potatoes, liver, eggs
+ <strong>Vitamin B<sub>2</sub></strong> (riboflavin): dairy products, bananas, green beans, asparagus
+ <strong>Vitamin B<sub>3</sub></strong> (niacin): meat, fish, eggs, many vegetables, mushrooms, tree nuts
+ <strong>Vitamin B<sub>5</sub></strong> (pantothenic acid): meat, broccoli, avocados
+ <strong>Vitamin B<sub>6</sub></strong> (pyridoxine): meat, vegetables, tree nuts, bananas
+ <strong>Vitamin B<sub>7</sub></strong> (biotin): raw egg yolk, liver, peanuts, leafy green vegetables
+ <strong>Vitamin B<sub>9</sub></strong> (folate): liver, legumes, asparagus, spinach, lettuce, nuts
+ <strong>Vitamin B<sub>12</sub></strong> (cobalamin): meat, fish, eggs, milk
+ **Vitamin C** (ascorbic acid): fresh fruits and vegetables, fresh meat and especially organ meat
+ **Vitamin D**: eggs, liver, sardines, shiitake mushrooms
+ **Vitamin E**: nut and seed oils, avocados, spinach, fish, oysters, butter
+ **Vitamin K**: leafy green vegetables, egg yolks, liver

## Other macronutrients

Water is essential for all life.

Carbohydrates are not considered essential nutrients per se but they offer a ready source of energy---glucose, a monosaccharide, is more or less universal. Carbohydrates
- Monosaccharides
   - Glucose: honey, fruits and vegetables, flowers
   - Fructose: honey, fruits and vegetables, flowers
   - Galactose
- Disaccharides
   - Sucrose (glucose + fructose): fruits and vegetables
   - Lactose (glucose + galactose): milk and other dairy products
   - Maltose (glucose + glucose): malted grain
- Polysaccharides
   - Starch (energy storage for plants): grains, root vegetables, legumes
      - Amylopectin + amylose
   - Glycogen (energy storage for animals, fungi, and bacteria): fresh raw or frozen meat (blubber, muscle of marine mammals)

Cellulose is a polysaccharide found in the cell walls of plants and is not digestible by humans, but instead serves as dietary fibre.
