## Staple foods

### Grains

Threshing separates the grain from the straw; winnowing removes the chaff or husk, leaving behind the whole grain (bran + germ + endosperm). Milling removes the bran and sometimes the germ, which may be used as food ingredients themselves.

+ bran + germ + endosperm
  - may be eaten as groats or berries, typically soaked first to soften
  - germinated
+ germ + endosperm
  - germinated
+ endosperm
  - cannot be germinated because the germ has already been removed

No or minimal processing:
+ freekeh
+ grain berries

### Dough

The most basic dough is made with **flour + water**. Less water will produce a thin, dry, hard cracker or crisp, such as commercially made [matzah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matzah); higher water content will give a softer result. Traditional [tlacoyos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tlacoyo) and some [corn tortillas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_tortilla) follow this formula, as do many pasta noodles. In order to produce a slightly more flavourful and structurally stable end product, **flour + water + salt** can be used, as in [chapatis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapati), some corn tortillas, or traditional Scandinavian [crispbreads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crispbread) and [flatbrød](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatbr%C3%B8d). Many [Chinese wheat noodles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_noodles) also follow this formula. Variations on plain water include lye water (as in [some Chinese noodles and ramen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_pasta) and in [bagels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagel)) and carbonated water (as in some [tempura batters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempura)).

The formula of **flour + water + salt + fat**, whether it be oil, butter, or rendered animal fat, requires less water to form a dough, but will develop less gluten and therefore less elasticity. Many flatbreads are produced with this formula, including [parathas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paratha), [wheat tortillas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flour_tortilla), and [piadina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piadina). Egg may be used in addition to or in place of water to serve as both a liquid and a fat, as in egg matzah and [some types of noodles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noodle#Egg). [Pastry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastry) dough uses the addition of large amounts of solid fat to slow the development of gluten, resulting in a final product that lacks the toughness and elasticity of bread. Doughs that use large amounts of solid fats may be called "short" doughs and include [shortcrusts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortcrust_pastry) used to make pies.

Leavened breads are made with **flour + water + salt + leavening agent**. This agent may be chemical, such as sodium bicarbonate in combination with an acid to produce carbon dioxide, as in [soda bread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soda_bread) or [cornbread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornbread) (formula **flour + buttermilk + baking soda**, where the buttermilk functions as both the liquid and the acid) or in buttermilk biscuits (formula **flour + buttermilk + baking soda + solid fat**). Shortcake is essentially a buttermilk biscuit with sugar added. Alternately, the water may be carbonated, and therefore act as both a liquid and a chemical leavener (as in tempura batter.)

The leavening agent can also be biological, such as yeast, which converts sugars into carbon dioxide. The basic formula is **flour + water + salt + yeast** or **flour + water + salt + yeast + sugar**. Countless breads fall into this category, both flatbreads ([lavash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavash), [naan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naan), [pita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pita), [Neapolitan pizza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neapolitan_pizza)) and loaf breads. A subtype is [sourdough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sourdough), which uses a naturally occurring culture of yeasts and lactic acid bacteria, typically saved from the previous batch of dough, and a long fermentation period. Yeast may also be obtained from beer, cider, or wine brewing processes, as in [barm cake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barm_cake) or [cider doughnuts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_cider#Variations); or from a pure culture of baker's yeast, in which case it is usually combined with refined sugar to allow it to ferment more quickly. Enriched breads add egg (such as [challah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challah)), or egg + milk or cream (such as [brioche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brioche)).

Different bread doughs may combine any of these methods, with yeast doughs including fat or unleavened doughs including sugar. Bread is commonly baked (as in loaf breads) or fried (as in many flatbreads) and less commonly steamed (as in [mantou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantou), or some types of [cornbread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornbread)); bagels are boiled before being baked.

Pasta dough flour + water or flour + egg (with or without water); flomaria flour + egg + milk + salt

Dumplings

Filo pastry, laminated pastry, puff pastry

Batter contains a higher liquid content, resulting in a runny consistency. It may be made according to the various formulas above---buttermilk pancakes and crepes are quick breads, while [injera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injera), [laḥuḥ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahoh), and [baghrir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghrir) are yeast-leavened; [blini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blini) and [cornbread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornbread) may be made either way.

Batter, leavened or not, may be used to coat foods before frying.

If left to sit, the less-dense fat will rise to the surface of the milk and can be skimmed off as cream; the remainder is what is typically referred to as milk.

Many dairy products can be derived from milk, cream, or a combination of the two by applying heat, introducing an agent that causes curdling, or both. Curdling causes the separation and coagulation of the dairy product into curds and whey. The curds are often drained to lower moisture content and give the product a longer shelf life; whey may be consumed as is or processed in the same way as milk.

There are a few ways of creating curds. The first is through heating alone. Another is through heat combined with acid - either a direct acid, such as by adding lemon juice (citric acid), vinegar (acetic acid), or cream of tartar (tartaric acid); calcium lactate; or by adding bacteria that produce lactic acid as a by-product of the metabolic process. Unpasteurized milk will curdle in this manner if left for a few days, as a result of the bacteria naturally present in the milk. The final way is with [rennet or a similar enzyme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rennet), combined with heat. The curds may be strained or pressed to remove moisture.

### Milk

Heat:
+ Unpasteurized milk left to ferment at a specific temperature and humidity becomes [clabber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clabber_(food)). [Jocoque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jocoque) is formed by leaving milk in a clay vessel near a heat source. [Agaran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chal) is cream collected from the surface of fermented camel milk.
+ [Condensed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensed_milk) and [evaporated milk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporated_milk). [Dulce de leche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dulce_de_leche). [Baked milk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baked_milk).
+ [Clotted cream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clotted_cream), [kaymak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaymak), [qishta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qishta), [malai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malai) (made from whole milk (full cream))
+ [Khoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khoa), milk solids.
+ Heated milk can produce [milk skin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_skin), used to make [so](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_(dairy_product)).

Acid:
+ [Cultured buttermilk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buttermilk#Cultured_buttermilk), [quick buttermilk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buttermilk#Acidified_buttermilk)
+ Direct acid: [queso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queso_blanco), [chhena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chhena), [paneer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paneer) (pressed chhena)
+ Lactic acid bacteria: [quark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark_(dairy_product)), [fromage blanc & fromage frais](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fromage_blanc); the whey byproduct of LAB fermentation is sour whey.
+ [Cottage cheese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cottage_cheese) (made by either method) has some of the whey drained off, and is then dressed with cream. It may be pressed to produce [farmer cheese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmer_cheese).

[Yogurt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogurt) is produced by adding a variety of thermophilic (heat-loving) lactic acid bacteria and heating. [Skyr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyr) is produced in a similar fashion, but uses skimmed milk and is heated to lower temperatures; [qatiq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatiq) is produced from milk that has been boiled and then fermented. Yogurt can be used to produce cultured yogurt butter and buttermilk such as [yayık ayranı](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yay%C4%B1k_ayran%C4%B1) or further processing of [matzoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matzoon); or it can be further fermented and coagulated, such as in some varieties of [çökelek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87%C3%B6kelek). Strained yogurt produces yogurt cheese such as [labneh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strained_yogurt) or [kashk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashk).

[filmjölk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmj%C3%B6lk), [ymer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ymer_(dairy_product)); [viili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viili) cultures generally include yeasts and other fungi.

Bacterial cultures that include yeasts can produce sparkling, mildly alcoholic fermented milk products such as [kefir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kefir) (which uses a starter culture of solid "grains"), [kumis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumis) (which uses a liquid starter culture and churning in addition to fermentation)

Rennet:
+ Minimally processed rennet cheese is referred to as fresh cheese; it may also contain bacterial cultures.
+ Cubed and pressed curds are [cheese curds or squeaky cheese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese_curd). [chongos zamoranos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chongos_zamoranos)
+ Sweetened milk warmed and curdled with rennet creates [junket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junket_(dessert)).
+ Drained, pressed, stretched, salted, brined, inoculated, ripened, smoked

Soft-ripened cheeses:
+ *Penicillium camemberti*: [Brie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brie), [Camembert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camembert), [Langres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langres_cheese), Coulommiers, [Chaource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaource_cheese)
+ *Geotrichum candida*: [Pérail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perail)
+ *Brevibacterium linens*

Sweet whey is the by-product of rennet cheese production. It too can be curdled with heat and acid to produce cheese, such as [ricotta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricotta) (produced by fermenting or acidifying and heating the sweet whey left over from mozzarella production) or [mizithra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizithra). These cheeses can be aged and ripened like other cheeses. Whey can also be boiled down to create [brunost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunost), mostly comprised of caramelized milk sugars, sometimes with cream added while reducing. [Blaand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaand) is a fermented (sweet?) whey drink with a low alcohol content, diluted with water before or after souring.

Butter can be produced from sour milk, which requires much longer periods of churning for butter to form.

### Cream

Churning produces [butter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butter) and [buttermilk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buttermilk), which may be made from cultured (sour) cream, the easiest kind to make without refrigeration, or fresh (sweet) cream. Butter can be heated to produce browned butter and [clarified butter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarified_butter), [ghee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghee), smen. Buttermilk may be additionally cultured if made from sweet cream; it can also be coagulated into cheese such as [Sarasson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarasson), [Caerphilly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caerphilly_cheese), [chura loenpa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chura_loenpa), [chura kampo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chura_kampo), or [çökelek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87%C3%B6kelek).

Heat:

Acid:
+ Coagulation with a direct acid produces [mascarpone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mascarpone), boursin, cream cheese?
+ A culture of lactic acid bacteria produces sour creams like [crème fraîche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr%C3%A8me_fra%C3%AEche) or [smetana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smetana_(cream)); these vary greatly in fat content, consistency, and duration of souring, based on regional preference. [Crema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crema_(dairy_product)) is made from a mix of cream and buttermilk.

Rennet
+ Rennet-curdled cream is drained and the curds sweetened to create [jonquet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junket_(dessert)#History), the ancestor of milk-based junket.

## Sweeteners

### Sugarcane

Raw sugarcane can be chewed to extract the juice, or crushed mechanically to produce larger quantities of juice. [Sugarcane juice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugarcane_juice) can be drunk as-is, served with additional flavourings, or fermented into alcoholic beverages such as [viche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viche_(drink)) or [basi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basi). [Cachaça](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cacha%C3%A7a), [seco herrerano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seco_Herrerano), and [rhum agricole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhum_agricole) are liquors distilled from fermented sugar cane juice.

In order to obtain sugar, the sugarcane juice is clarified and filtered to remove impurities and encourage coagulation of the sugar crystals, before being boiled in order to evaporate the water content until crystallization is achieved. At this stage the syrup may be poured into molds to solidify (video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC6ARq8SZAI) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaMA54IR7aE)), or agitated to produce a granulated form ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipLkctdZ0C8)). The result is a non-centrifugal brown sugar, such as [jaggery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaggery), [panela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panela), or [peen tong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peen_tong).

[Molasses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molasses) is also obtained by boiling down the sugarcane juice, but without allowing it to crystallize so as to remain in liquid form. Longer boiling times produce increasingly darker grades of molasses, with the lightest sometimes known as [cane syrup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steen%27s_cane_syrup) and the darkest known as blackstrap molasses ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJWLVMAN7jU)). Molasses may also be produced by pressing (video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tCmMldyh2c) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QORjR-51Wlk)).

Molasses can be [fermented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rum#Fermentation) into [beer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molasses#Cane_molasses), and the beer distilled into [rum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rum) and other liquors.

[Wasanbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasanbon) is produced by kneading and washing sugar in water, pressing to remove some of the molasses content, and then drying, crushing, and sifting until a fine powdered sugar remains (video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpKIUahzevY) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBMUyrMv3GM)).

[Rock sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_candy) is produced by dissolving sugar in water to form a syrup; adding additional sugar to form a supersaturated solution; introducing an object such as a stick or a string for sugar crystals to form on; and then allowing the crystals to grow undisturbed for several days.
