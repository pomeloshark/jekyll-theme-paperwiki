**Lài ráp** is a soup made with a variety of unripened or sour fruit, typically melon, tamarind, sea buckthorn, wolfberry, kiwi, quince, starfruit, persimmon, or mango; crispy quick pickles in a sweet and sour vinegar brine; fresh ginger, green onions, garlic, bean or lentil sprouts, snow peas, and lemon or lime juice; fewer spices than is typical, usually fresh black pepper, star anise, and dill and mustard seeds; and plenty of fresh herbs and leafy greens, particularly basil, lemongrass, and lemon leaves; often eaten cold, over dumplings or noodles. It is very bright and tangy at its mildest, eye-wateringly sour at its strongest.
