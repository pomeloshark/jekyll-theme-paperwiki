**Padu** is the fourth planet from the star [Olju](/wiki/olju) and the only planet known to harbour life. It is approximately 4.5 billion years old; life evolved early in its history and helped shape the oceans and landforms of Padu's surface. Several hundred million humans call Padu home, dependent on its oxygen-rich atmosphere, abundance of liquid water, and the many other organisms that live there for survival.

## Orbit and rotation

Padu's rotational period or sidereal day is 26.81 hours; the synodic day, the one used in timekeeping, is 26.87 hours [26h 52m 26s]. At an orbital radius of 1.2229 astronomical units, the tropical year is 419.75 days. The actual orbital period is longer by about 40 minutes.

## Moons

Padu has two natural satellites, both small rocky moons, known as [Chasuhimu]() and [Wichaqanu](). Chasuhimu has a radius of 1531km and a synodic period of 18.94 Padu days, meaning there are around 22.16 months in a year; Wichaqanu has a radius of 1038km and a synodic period of 49.21 days, about 8.53 months to a year. The angular diameter of Chasuhimu is 0.517°---about half the width of a human finger when the hand is held out at arm's length in front of the face. Wichaqanu's angular diameter is much smaller, at 0.19°.

The gravitational effects of the two moons produce complex tidal patterns on Padu.
