For storing your worldbuilding notes! The intent of this theme is to get all the code out of the way and to allow you to write Markdown articles; the best way to do that is to install the theme as a gem. However, if you want to tinker with the code, just download this repository.

For the easiest starting point, I have uploaded a [sample site](https://github.com/pomeloshark/paperwiki-example) that you can download with everything preconfigured, so if you're unfamiliar with Jekyll you can bypass all the setup and get right to it. See that repo for instructions.

I've tried to adhere to accessible and easy to read design principles while retaining the look and layout of a classic wiki that we're all familiar with - I've aped some elements of Wikipedia's organizational system and layout while trying to make it as clean and user friendly as possible.

This theme is not mobile friendly, as I personally do absolutely no work on mobile and thus my development skills are lacking. I stuck in a couple CSS breakpoints, so it'll be mostly legible on a medium-sized tablet, but don't expect great results on a phone. There is also no dark mode or other alternate colour scheme, but please feel free to fork this project and add whatever functionality you're looking for.

This theme is not really intended for blogging, but you could add in the functionality easily enough by creating a `_posts` collection and setting a default post layout in the config file, as there is a dedicated `post` layout, as well as a `blog.md` which will list all of your blog posts on one page. If you have no need for it you can delete this file.



## Usage

In case you're unfamiliar with it, a basic Jekyll site includes the following:
+ The `_includes` folder contains snippets of HTML that are frequently reused on pages throughout the website. This saves us from having to copy and paste the HTML on multiple pages, and we only have to edit it in one file in order to change every instance of it.
+ The `_layouts` folder contains the formatting for different types of pages, meaning that instead of formatting each page individually we can just specify which layout template to use.
+ The `_sass` folder contains all the styling for the site, written in SCSS.
+ The `_site` folder contains everything that Jekyll outputs when it builds the site. Don't edit anything in this folder, as it will be rewritten the next time you serve the site.
+ The `assets` folder contains things like fonts, images, and Javascript files. It also contains a `.scss` file importing all of your SCSS so that Jekyll can convert it to regular CSS.

This theme comes with all of these prepackaged, so most of what you have to do is edit the `_config.yaml` file. The theme has some default config set already, but you can override these in your own config file if you wish. You can also add any of the above folders to your own project with includes, layouts, or SCSS to override the theme's files. For example, you will want to add your own `assets` folder to store your own images, including one titled `favicon.png` in order to override the placeholder one i've included.



## Installation

[Install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/). If you're using the example site linked above, you can skip ahead to the [using the wiki](#using-the-wiki) section. Otherwise, create a new site by running the following in your terminal:

```
$ jekyll new MYSITENAME
```

This will give you a very bare bones Jekyll site, with an index page, a folder for blog posts, a config file, and a Gemfile. You'll have to do a little setup to make it usable with this theme. Here's what the directory should look like:

```
.
├── _pages/
│   ├── wiki/ # In here is where your organizational pages for your wiki will go.
├── _posts/ # If you want to write blog posts, they go in here.
├── _site/
├── collections/
│   ├── _wiki/ # In here is where all your articles will go, in markdown or html files.
├── _config.yml
├── 404.html
├── about.md
├── Gemfile
├── index.md
```

(Don't worry about the .gitignore or the Gemfile.lock.)

To use this theme, open your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`, delete the line that says `gem "minima"` and replace it with this line:

```ruby
gem "jekyll-theme-paperwiki", "~> [version]"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: jekyll-theme-paperwiki
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```
$ gem install jekyll-theme-paperwiki
```

To serve your site locally, navigate into the site's directory and run:

```
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Navigate to your localhost and...you will see an empty page. This is because the layout in the default `index.md` is not set properly. Open this file and change the layout like so:

```yaml
layout: launchpad
```

This will show you the default wiki homepage. The three links - explore, contents, and random page - link to pages that are included with the theme, and consist of pregenerated content based on the wiki articles you've written. Now you can start adding articles in your `_wiki` folder.



### Using the wiki

All of your wiki pages should be written in Markdown, and you must begin each `.md` file like so:

```
---
---
```

Between these two lines is where you include *front matter*, such as specifying the layout or the permalink to the page. However, you can leave the front matter blank - wiki pages have layouts and permalinks set by default in the theme's config file, and you only need to specify them if you want to override the defaults. You also do not need to specify a title for the page, as it is automatically taken from the filename. All you absolutely need is the two triple-dashed lines, as Jekyll needs it to know that the front matter is there in order to output the page.

Caveats:
- If the site won't build due to an error with the random page, make sure you have more than one wiki article for it to draw from
- You may need to specify a permalink and a title if you want to use certain characters that are not allowed in filenames -- say, some IPA characters. Otherwise just title your articles "Article title.md", with spaces, not underscores or hyphens, and the default settings will take care of the rest.
